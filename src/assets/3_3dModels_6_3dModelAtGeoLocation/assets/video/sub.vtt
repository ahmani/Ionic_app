00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,200
The club isn't the best place
to find a lover

1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,900
So the bar is where I go

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,200
Me and my friends at the table
doing shots

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,400
You come over and start up a
conversation with just me

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,800
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Take my hand, stop

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,100
And then we start to dance

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,300
And now I'm singing like

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,600
Girl, you know I want your love

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,500
Your love was handmade for
somebody like me

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,100
Come on now, follow my lead

13
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,700
I may be crazy, don't mind me

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,300
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,400
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Come on now, follow my lead

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,100
Come, come on now, follow my lead

18
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm in love with the shape of you

19
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
We push and pull like a magnet do

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,300
Although my heart is falling too

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,900
I'm in love with your body

22
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,300
And last night you were in my room

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,600
And now my bedsheets smell like you

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,200
Every day discovering
something brand new

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
I'm in love with your body

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm in love with your body

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm in love with your body

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,300
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm in love with your body

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,500
Every day discovering
something brand new

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm in love with the shape of you

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,900
One week in we let the story begin

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,600
We're going out on our first date

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,000
You and me are thrifty

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
So go all you can eat

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,700
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

39
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
We talk for hours and hours
about the sweet and the sour

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,700
And how your family is doing okay

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,300
Leave and get in a taxi, then
kiss in the backseat

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,200
Tell the driver make the radio play

43
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
And I'm singing like

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,300
Girl, you know I want your love

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,400
Your love was handmade for
somebody like me

46
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
Come on now, follow my lead

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,600
I may be crazy, don't mind me

48
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,300
Say, boy, let's not talk too much

49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,400
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Come on now, follow my lead

51
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Come, come on now, follow my lead

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm in love with the shape of you

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,800
We push and pull like a magnet do

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,300
Although my heart is falling too

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm in love with your body

56
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,200
And last night you were in my room

57
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
And now my bedsheets smell like you

58
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,200
Every day discovering
something brand new

59
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm in love with your body

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,900
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

61
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,900
I'm in love with your body

62
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,200
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,900
I'm in love with your body

64
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,200
Oh I oh I oh I oh I

65
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm in love with your body

66
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,200
Every day discoveri
