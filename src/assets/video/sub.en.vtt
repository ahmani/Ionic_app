NOTE Paragraph

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:50.595
Think about 'em, the generations and to say
that we want to make it a better place

00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:55.209
for our children and our children's children,
so that they,

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:59.019
they, they know it's a better world for
them.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.978
I think they can make it a better place.

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:14.698
There's a place in your heart 
and I know that it is Love.

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:20.824
And this place could be
much brighter than tomorrow.

00:01:20.838 --> 00:01:26.818
And if you really try you'll find there's no need to cry.

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:32.656
In this place you'll feel
there's no hurt or sorrow.

00:01:32.668 --> 00:01:38.738
There are ways to get there
if you care enough for the living.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.470
Make a little space,
make a better place.

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:47.497
Heal the world.

00:01:47.497 --> 00:01:53.657
Make it a better place
for you and for me

00:01:53.657 --> 00:01:56.477
and the entire human race.

00:01:56.477 --> 00:02:02.547
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:07.267
make a better place for
you and for me.

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:17.066
If you want to know why,
there's a love that cannot lie.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:22.626
Love is strong.
It only cares for joyful giving.

00:02:22.626 --> 00:02:28.856
If we try we shall see
in this bliss we cannot feel

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:34.586
fear or dread.
We stop existing and start living.

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:41.106
Then it feels that always
love's enough for us growing.

00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:46.386
Make a better world.
Make a better world.

00:02:46.786 --> 00:02:49.316
Heal the world.

00:02:49.746 --> 00:02:58.646
Make it a better place for you and for me
and the entire human race.

00:02:58.646 --> 00:03:04.996
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:03:04.996 --> 00:03:10.306
make a better place for
you and for me.

00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:16.453
And the dream we were conceived in
will reveal a joyful face.

00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:22.391
And the world we once believed in
will shine again in grace.

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:28.601
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Wound this earth, crucify it's soul,

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:34.421
though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly.
Be God's glow.

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:40.151
We could fly so high.
Let our spirits never die.

00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:45.899
In my heart I feel
you are all my brothers.

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:52.009
Create a world with no fear.
Together we'll cry happy tears.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:58.315
See the nations turn
their swords into plowshares.

00:03:58.315 --> 00:04:04.225
We could really get there
if you cared enough for the living.

00:04:04.225 --> 00:04:09.695
Make a little space
to make a better place.

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:12.515
Heal the world.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:21.329
Make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.889
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.909
make a better place for
you and for me.

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:36.445
Heal the world.

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:45.295
Make it a better place
for you and for me and the entire human race.

00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:51.645
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:56.505
Make a better place for you and for me

00:04:57.204 --> 00:05:00.174
Heal the world

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:05.227
Make it a better place for you and for me

00:05:05.227 --> 00:05:10.280
And the entire human race

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.334
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:05:15.334 --> 00:05:20.504
make a better place for
you and for me.

00:05:20.504 --> 00:05:27.074
There are people dying.
If you care enough for the living

00:05:27.074 --> 00:05:32.524
Then make a better place for you and for me

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.502
There are people dying

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:40.305
If you care enough for the living

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:44.109
Make a better place for you and for me

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:47.959
You and for me

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:50.299
Make a better place

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.290
Make a better place

00:05:54.758 --> 00:06:00.118
Heal the world we live in

99:59:59.999 --> 99:59:59.999
Save it for our children.
